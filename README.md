This repo is for the creation of Brick Breaker in Unity

As part of learning Unity course.

06.14.25: Added Physics engine and breakable bricks

06.22.25: Added a game manager, a random level generator, Score counter with multi brick hit bonus and a GAME OVER title. (Didn't have time to program a hit bonus text, hopefully for next week)
